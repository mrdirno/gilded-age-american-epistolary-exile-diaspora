  "cover_prompt": "A young woman in a sumptuous but slightly frayed Gilded Age gown stands on a windswept coastal cliff, her back to the viewer as she releases a bundle of handwritten letters that scatter like birds into the grey sky, their pages fluttering against a backdrop where a fading, ornate American mansion half-dissolves into the stern, grey stone facade of an English manor house. The scene is imbued with a profound sense of loss and transition, with symbolic details like a tarnished piece of jewelry in the grass and a single, resilient wildflower growing from a crack in the cliff, merging the opulent decay of one world with the rigid austerity of the next, in the atmospheric style of a Pre-Raphaelite narrative painting combined with the muted, emotional realism of Edward Hopper. Book cover framing, centered and intimate yet vast in implication, viewed from a low, dramatic angle that emphasizes the vast, empty ocean horizon and the woman's solitary, determined silhouette against the tumultuous sky. Chiaroscuro lighting with a single, cold beam of sunlight breaking through storm clouds, casting a gilded edge on the letters and her gown, within a melancholic color palette of leaden greys, deep navy, faded gold, and muted burgundy. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
